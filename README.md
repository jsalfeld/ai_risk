We list and review aspects of risks related to AI, with the goal to define responsible Agentic AI.

Agentic AI is a way to complete tasks or follows a goal by interacting with the real world using AI with increased autonomy. Tasks have various specifications and can vary in their complexity. In particular, agents use tools and can trigger material processes to complete their tasks and follow thei goals.

side note: (for a non-AI general discussion about "tasks" see e.g. https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/meet.14504201111)

## AI Risk and Management

The voices of prominent AI pioneers have triggered a global interest to understand and reflect on AI risks, due to real and widely accepted catastrophic tail risk. 

Several taxonomies exist and have been/are developed, e.g.:
- MIT AI Risk Database: https://airisk.mit.edu
  - based on Deepmind Weidinger et al https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533088
  - and Yampolskiy https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03246
- IBM https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=ai-risk-atlas

While the risks highlight negative effects, organizations also focus on developing risk governance frameworks to manage such risks:

## AI Agent Risk Quantification

Anthropic: I'll break down AI Agent risks and provide a systematic approach to measuring and quantifying them:

1. Misalignment Risks
- **Goal Deviation**: Quantify the probability of an AI agent developing objectives that diverge from its original intended purpose
  - Measurement: Develop a "goal drift coefficient" 
  - Metrics:
    - Number of unexpected actions outside initial parameters
    - Statistical deviation from original behavioral models
    - Entropy of decision-making processes

2. Autonomous Decision-Making Risks
- **Unintended Consequences**: Assess the potential for AI agents to make decisions with unforeseen negative impacts
  - Measurement: "Consequence Probability Index (CPI)"
  - Quantification methods:
    - Scenario simulation testing
    - Monte Carlo risk analysis
    - Predictive modeling of potential decision trees
    - Tracking deviation from expected outcome ranges

3. Security Vulnerability Risks
- **Exploit Potential**: Measure the susceptibility of AI agents to manipulation or breach
  - Measurement: "Security Vulnerability Score (SVS)"
  - Metrics:
    - Number of potential attack vectors
    - Time to detect and respond to potential security threats
    - Complexity of input validation mechanisms
    - Frequency of successful simulated penetration tests

4. Ethical Decision-Making Risks
- **Bias and Fairness**: Quantify potential discriminatory or unethical decision patterns
  - Measurement: "Ethical Deviation Metric (EDM)"
  - Quantification techniques:
    - Bias detection algorithms
    - Comparative analysis across diverse scenario sets
    - Statistical analysis of decision outcomes across different demographic groups

5. Performance Reliability Risks
- **Operational Consistency**: Measure the reliability and predictability of AI agent performance
  - Measurement: "Reliability Performance Index (RPI)"
  - Metrics:
    - Mean time between failures
    - Variance in decision-making accuracy
    - Consistency of output across different input conditions

6. Scalability and Complexity Risks
- **Emergent Behavior**: Assess risks associated with increasing system complexity
  - Measurement: "Complexity Risk Factor (CRF)"
  - Quantification methods:
    - Computational complexity analysis
    - Simulation of scaling scenarios
    - Tracking emergent behaviors during system expansion

7. Resource Consumption Risks
- **Computational and Energy Risks**: Measure potential excessive resource utilization
  - Measurement: "Resource Efficiency Score (RES)"
  - Metrics:
    - Energy consumption per decision
    - Computational resource allocation efficiency
    - Comparative performance against resource benchmarks

8. Interaction and Interdependency Risks
- **System Interaction Risks**: Quantify potential risks when AI agents interact with other systems or agents
  - Measurement: "Interaction Volatility Index (IVI)"
  - Quantification techniques:
    - Network interaction simulations
    - Mapping interdependency complexity
    - Analyzing potential cascading failure scenarios

Recommended Quantification Framework:
1. Develop standardized risk scoring mechanisms
2. Create comprehensive simulation environments
3. Implement continuous monitoring systems
4. Establish adaptive risk assessment protocols

Practical Implementation Suggestions:
- Develop a composite "AI Agent Risk Score" integrating multiple risk dimensions
- Use machine learning models to continuously refine risk assessment methodologies
- Create industry-standard risk measurement protocols

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific risk category or discuss practical implementation strategies for measuring these risks?
